DSA Lab Assignment for 05/09/2020</br>
<br> We were supposed to allocate the array or matrix using malloc functions.</br>
<br> We must ensure that your solution defends any test-cases. For instance, 1x1
matrix.</br>
<br>Input should be given by random function and the code snippet of a single
dimensional array is given below-</br>
<br>#include&lt;stdlib.h&gt;<br>
<br>#include&lt;time.h&gt;<br>
<br>srand(time(0));<br>
<br>for(i=0;i&lt;n;i++)<br>
<br>a[i]=(rand()%(upper_limit-lower_limit +1))+lower_limit;<br>
